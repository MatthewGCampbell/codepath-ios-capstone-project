## Overview

### Description

[An app that helps you track your vintage macintosh inventory and helps you understand how rare your collection is and what you might want to add to make it more desirable]

### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** A mobile focused app allows users to add to their inventory using their iPhone's camera, and makes it easy to access on the go.
- **Story:** The audience for this app is very focused and it would help them orgonize their collection and understand what they have better espically if they are just getting into the hobby
- **Market:** The market for this app is very unique
- **Habit:** Instead of having to spend hours doing research on what exactly you have and how valuable it is this app give you a one stop shop platform for all of the necessary information
- **Scope:** I don't think it will be too much of a challenge it is just a collection of items pulled from an API/Database at least for the MVP
