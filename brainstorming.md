## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
1. ChatGPT clone
   - **Description**: Allows students to use a custom GPT to help them learn as opposed to something like chatGPT that will give the student the answer
   - **Category:** Education
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is necessary for being able to access the camera so that students can upload images of their work and the GPT can figure out what they need help with.
   - **Story:** Creates a better relationship between the student and the gpt as well as the teachers willingness to allow the student to use the tool as it is being used as an aid as opposed to having the ability to make it to the work for them
   - **Market:** Any student that is struggling with learning and needs additional help that the teacher is unable to offer it also helps bring the load off of teachers in higher education 
   - **Habit:** Students are using chatGPT to help them with their homework anyway and making the tool more of a aid for education as opposed to what we have right now will help teachers be more willing to implement it into their classrooms
   - **Scope:** My MVP will just focus on the custom GPT and a texting like interface
2. Inventory App
    - **Description:** Allows people with lots of items sort them into bins so that locating the items is easy to do with qr codes

    - **Market:** Anyone struggling with finding items that they have orgonized in containers as you sometimes have to search through the containers even if you have labels for the containers espically if you have containers inside of contianers
    - **Habit:** Instead of searching for something for hours or ordoring more parts that you already have you have a catalog online where you can find exactly what you need if you have it and where it is
    - **Scope:** My MVP will help a user add an item to their inventory use the camera for adding an items picture as well as scanning the qr codes on the containers
3. Vintage Macintosh Collection
